##### :construction: making a school system for teachers, students and admin :construction:

The concept of this project is to have a school system where users can create new accounts, 
store their information to a database, update their information and have administrative priviledges based on their role.

# We're going hard on this one!

### Going to integrate a database with this application after the gui has been completed, most of the key functionality has been added already aside from mysql integration

##### Coming up:

> 1: Classes created for students, admin and teachers :white_check_mark: 

> 2: Some basic password hashing (this isn't overly secure but it is not the primary focus here):white_check_mark:

> 3: Basic gui implementation :white_check_mark:

> 4: Submit users to and search for users in the database :white_check_mark:

> 5: User login and update information pages :negative_squared_cross_mark: 

> 6: Views based on user type and login status :negative_squared_cross_mark: 

### This is a big project for me and if I see it through it will be my best project to date

:shipit: enjoy! :shipit:
